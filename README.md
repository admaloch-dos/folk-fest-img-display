# Florida Folk Festival image display

<b>About this project:</b><br/>
This image display was created to be showcased at the annual Florida Folk Festival. It contains over 1000 photographs, handpicked by our photo lab staff, and an audio player with music from the Florida Memory audio collection.
The project was created with a Bootstrap image carousel but with more customizable features added to allow the user more control over speed, transition effects, etc.
In addition, QR codes are generated for each image that link to an item page on the Florida Memory website. The user can select between a regular QR code and a code with the current image embedded.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/>
--<b>Javascript</b><br/>
--<b><a href="https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs">qrcodejs</a>:</b> Plugin to generate QR codes<br/>
--<b><a href="https://github.com/kciter/qart.js">qart.js</a>:</b> Plugin to insert an image over QR codes<br/>
--<b>HTML</b><br/>
--<b>CSS</b><br/>
--<b>Bootstrap</b><br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/>
The most challenging aspect of this project involved working with QR codes and determining how to dynamically load them. Qrcode.js and Qart are not configured by default for this task, so I had to experiment with them to find a solution. Additionally, designing the menu and incorporating extra controls to customize the Bootstrap slider was a valuable experience.

<b>Current Status:</b><br/>
The project is complete and was successfully utilized at the Florida Folk Festival.

<b>Note:</b><br/>
Due to server failure issues and a lack of reliable internet at the festival, all images are incorporated into the project. GitHub did not allow uploading a large number of photos, so a link to Netlify, where this is not an issue, is provided. 

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The Florida Department of State prioritizes security, and version control software is not allowed, limiting the visibility of a detailed commit history for this project.
