# Florida Folk Festival image display

<b>About this project:</b><br/>
This image display was created to be showcased at the annual Florida Folk Festival. It contains over 1000 photographs, handpicked by our photo lab staff, data for each image, an audio player, video, and dynamically generated, image-based qr-codes.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/>
--<b>Javascript</b><br/>
--<b><a href="https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs">qrcodejs</a>:</b> Plugin to generate QR codes<br/>
--<b><a href="https://github.com/kciter/qart.js">qart.js</a>:</b> Plugin to insert an image over QR codes<br/>
--<b>HTML</b><br/>
--<b>CSS</b><br/>
--<b>Bootstrap</b><br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/>
The most challenging aspect of this project involved working with QR codes and determining how to dynamically load them. Qrcode.js and Qart are not configured by default for this task, so I had to experiment with them to find a solution. Additionally, designing the menu and incorporating extra controls to customize the Bootstrap slider was a valuable experience.

<b>Current Status:</b><br/>
The project is complete and was successfully utilized at the Florida Folk Festival.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The Florida Department of State prioritizes security, and version control software is not allowed, limiting the visibility of a detailed commit history for this project.
