Florida Folk Festival image display with qr codes and music player.

This image carousel was created to be displayed at the annual Florida Folk Festival. It contains over 1000 photographs, handpicked by our photo lab staff, and an audio player with tracks from the Florida Memory audio collection.
The project was created with bootstrap, but with more customizable features added to allow the user more control over speed, transition effects etc. 
In addition, qr codes are generated for each image that link to an item page on the Florida Memory website. The user can select between a regular qr code and a code with the current image imbedded. Qrcode.js and Qart.js were used to generate these codes.
